\subsection{Linux/BlueZ}

It is necessary to add a new entry with the following format
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
REMOTE PIN
\end{lstlisting}
to
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
/var/lib/bluetooth/LOCAL/pincodes
\end{lstlisting}
where:
\begin{compactitem}
\item \emph{LOCAL} is the address of the Bluetooth device connected to PC;
\item \emph{REMOTE} is the address of the remote Bluetooth device (in our case, the Elm327 interface);
\item \emph{PIN} is the pin code used by the remote Bluetooth device for pairing.
\end{compactitem}
